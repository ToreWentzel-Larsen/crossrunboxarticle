## Introduction

Within statistical process control (SPC) runs analysis is being used to detect persistent shifts in process location over time. 

We have previously shown that runs analysis using the Anhøj rules have comparable or even better diagnostic properties than traditional control chart rules that are commonly used to detect minor to moderate *persistens* shifts in process location \citep{anhoej2018}.
